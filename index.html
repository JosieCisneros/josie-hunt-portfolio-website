        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello Beautiful! <br>
            My name is Josie Hunt, your local Denver REB3L Fitness instructor! Providing you a fitness platform where there is no judgment, tons of fun and a community that's got your back. <br>
            I became a REB3L instructor because I love to dance and the beauty of dancing is there is no right way to do it. In REB3L, if you're sweating and having a great time, you're doing it right.
        </p>
        <h4>What is REB3L</h4>
        <p>Driven by beats, sweat, and community, REB3L reveals your power, creates confidence, and builds strength through high intensity, fun full body workouts.
